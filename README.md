#Kitchen Store API
##Project Targets
1. Create an API for any user to do CRUD operations on products. Products should be members of logical houses 
(containers)

##Product Requirements
* Easy to change stuff - easy to add, delete, update (CRUD operations). Shouldn't be slower than doing it without the 
app
* Should have scope to scan barcodes and add products based on barcodes (client specification)
* Should track expiry dates and provide warnings
* Should divide products into logical segments
* Should generate shopping lists on demand
